# PipeCraft Configuration for Gluecraft
# Automated versioning, tagging, and GitHub releases for GitHub Action publishing

ciProvider: github
mergeStrategy: fast-forward
requireConventionalCommits: true

# PipeCraft branch flow for library/action publishing
# Code flows: develop → main (production)
initialBranch: develop
finalBranch: main

# Branch promotion flow: develop → main
branchFlow:
  - develop
  - main

# No domain-based testing needed (single package)
# But we can define a single domain for the action itself
domains:
  action:
    description: 'GitHub Action and CLI package'
    paths:
      - '**/*'

# Release configuration
# When code is merged to main, PipeCraft will:
# 1. Calculate version from conventional commits
# 2. Create git tag (v2.0.0, v2.1.0, etc.)
# 3. Update major version tag (v2) to point to latest
# 4. Create GitHub release
# 5. Optionally publish to NPM (handled separately or in custom job)
